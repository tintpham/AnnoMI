And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe.

And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know.

I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah.

Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.

Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right.

Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back.

I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.

What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah.", "response": "-that-that, um, that has to happen.

And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?", "response": "Yes.

I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\".

I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it?

I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know.

So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be.

I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah.

And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden.

I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.

I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah.

Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.

Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy.

Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot.

Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.

What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal.

And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal.

Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah.

No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal. Really? Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does. And you have found a way to get home and you seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of strength there that you're working with. Thank you. Thank you. And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there. Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital?", "response": "Not yet.", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah.

That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal. Really? Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does. And you have found a way to get home and you seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of strength there that you're working with. Thank you. Thank you. And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there. Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital? Not yet. Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you- Mm-hmm. -about- Mm-hmm. -this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did.", "response": "I'm really glad you did too.

No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want.

I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal. Really? Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does. And you have found a way to get home and you seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of strength there that you're working with. Thank you. Thank you. And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there. Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital? Not yet. Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you- Mm-hmm. -about- Mm-hmm. -this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did. I'm really glad you did too. I really appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together- Yeah. - to help you feel safer. And I hope you're going away home today feeling safer. Yeah. So the-the caseworker is gonna be able to come and refresh-", "response": "Mm-hmm.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah.

Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for.

I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm.

Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal.

And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal. Really? Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does. And you have found a way to get home and you seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of strength there that you're working with. Thank you. Thank you. And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there. Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital? Not yet. Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you- Mm-hmm. -about- Mm-hmm. -this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did. I'm really glad you did too. I really appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together- Yeah. - to help you feel safer. And I hope you're going away home today feeling safer. Yeah. So the-the caseworker is gonna be able to come and refresh- Mm-hmm. -me? We'll get you hooked up. And-and that's-- Yeah.", "response": "Mm-hmm.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home. Pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there. Yeah. What are you really glad about? Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home. Yeah. Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home. I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going? Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely.

Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually. So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down. Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that. Mm. So you've been working really hard- Yeah. -through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home. Yes. And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things. Yeah. And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work. Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah. What are you concerned about? That I'll- that I'll fall again. Mm-hmm. I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself. No. And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall. No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something- Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home. And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down. Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down- Yeah, yeah. Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi. Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which- Yeah. -might have probably helped you break your fall this time. Right, right. Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that? She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\" That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know. Right. But, um- So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home- Right. -and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe. Yeah. Wh-what do you think about that? Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling- Yeah. -really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that. Yeah, right. So, um, 'cause I am alone. Yeah, yeah. So\u2014 So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah. What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have? Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if- Yeah, yeah. -if something does happen? Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV. Mm-hmm. Is it- does it really work? It does really work. 'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk] Right. Right. It's crazy, it's crazy. No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips. Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared- Mm-hmm. -you know, about that happening and- Yeah. So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes. Mm-hmm. Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to? We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe. Yeah. So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider. That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that. Mm. I definitely wanna do that. Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe? Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and- Yeah, yeah. -one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs] Mm-hmm. So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives- Yeah. -far away. Yeah. So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends. So you'd like to have a little bit more support- Mm-hmm. -and a little bit more connection maybe that- Yeah. -that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that? Yeah. Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home- Right. -and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you? Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi? Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before- Yes, great place. -and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help with some of that support. Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving? Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe. Yeah. And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be. Really? Yes. Oh, okay. Can't prevent all of it- Uh-huh. -but we can make it less likely. Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for. Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet. Mm-hmm. And that's a strong enough motivator for you and gives you enough purpose that you're willing to like kind of push through that fear that even though it's there and that, that sense of- Yeah. -concern about being safe. Yeah. I- Yeah. -I-I am. And I feel like I have some help. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay. -again, and-and- So, am I being a baby? Not at all. Okay. Not being a baby. This is a pretty normal- this is- Really? -very normal. Absolutely. It's an absolutely normal thing to feel that, and especially when you've suffered something that you have and suffered to it, the stroke and the trying to get rehabbed and trying to find a way to get back home and going through the wobblies, this is perfectly normal. Really? Yes. And actually, you-you have really demonstrated to me anyway, a lot of strength and courage because you have continued to persevere and work through this and not everybody does. And you have found a way to get home and you seem really committed to staying home. So you-you've got a lot of strength there that you're working with. Thank you. Thank you. And we can work together to make sure that-- And-and Dr. Fields too, I know, is very interested in that. We can work together to do what we can to keep you there. Well, and she- she's not going to throw me back into the hospital? Not yet. Not yet? [laughs] Okay. Yeah. I was sort of- I-I was sort of hesitant to tell you- Mm-hmm. -about- Mm-hmm. -this, but, um, uh, I'm sort of glad I did. I'm very glad I did. I'm really glad you did too. I really appreciate it because that's the only way that we can work together- Yeah. - to help you feel safer. And I hope you're going away home today feeling safer. Yeah. So the-the caseworker is gonna be able to come and refresh- Mm-hmm. -me? We'll get you hooked up. And-and that's-- Yeah. Mm-hmm. I mean, that alone, to know that I have communication that I w- that was my biggest fear that something- Mm-hmm. -would happen and I wouldn't have any- Mm. -any way to tell anybody.", "response": "Good.

Hi. Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by. Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil. So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about? I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing. So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking. I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her. Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately. Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now. So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it? It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out. What else? Tell me what else is good about it. Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight. Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it? Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much. So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out. Okay. So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke. That's true. Yeah. You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up. Yeah. I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking? Exactly. So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things? Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking. Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her? Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke. So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you? I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan.

Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter- Mm-hmm. -um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together? It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right. So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you? I can't think of anything right now. Okay. I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about. So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, \"How could I do it that would work for me?\" Exactly. Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful? Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah.", "response": "Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk]", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Sandra. Hi. Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by. Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil. So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about? I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing. So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking. I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her. Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately. Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now. So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it? It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out. What else? Tell me what else is good about it. Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight. Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it? Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much. So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out. Okay. So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke. That's true. Yeah. You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up. Yeah. I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking? Exactly. So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things? Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking. Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her? Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke. So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you? I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan. And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up.

A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls.

Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah.

So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah.

But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm.", "response": "So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay.

What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing.", "response": "Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped.", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay. But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm. So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014 Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- Yeah. -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so- Mm. -I don't know. Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal.

So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay. But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm. So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014 Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- Yeah. -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so- Mm. -I don't know. Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing. Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped. Yeah. Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch? I don't know, you tell me. How about then your-your kind of hunch about that? Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so- Mm. -you know, it did, so I'm here-", "response": "Yeah-", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing. Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped. Yeah. Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch? I don't know, you tell me. How about then your-your kind of hunch about that? Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so- Mm. -you know, it did, so I'm here- Yeah- -so, I suppose\u2014 -so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here? It's a couple of grand or something. Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah. Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour-", "response": "Mm.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay. But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm. So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014 Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- Yeah. -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so- Mm. -I don't know. Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money.

[chuckles] And that's gonna support me?", "response": "Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together.

Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour- Mm. -$25, you do the math. [chuckles] And that's gonna support me? Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles? I don't know. I'm usually an open person. [chuckles] Yeah? Yeah. Just provided it will help me deal with it.", "response": "Yeah, yeah.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay. But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm. So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014 Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- Yeah. -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so- Mm. -I don't know. Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing. Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped. Yeah. Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch? I don't know, you tell me. How about then your-your kind of hunch about that? Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so- Mm. -you know, it did, so I'm here- Yeah- -so, I suppose\u2014 -so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day?

Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour- Mm. -$25, you do the math. [chuckles] And that's gonna support me? Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles? I don't know. I'm usually an open person. [chuckles] Yeah? Yeah. Just provided it will help me deal with it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about? I don't know. I am just usually pretty open with people. It's a bit different here tonight and- Yeah. -just not knowing what to expect then\u2014", "response": "Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far?", "therapist_behavior": "reflection", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay. But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm. So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014 Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- Yeah. -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so- Mm. -I don't know. Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing. Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped. Yeah. Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch? I don't know, you tell me. How about then your-your kind of hunch about that? Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so- Mm. -you know, it did, so I'm here- Yeah- -so, I suppose\u2014 -so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day?

I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that? I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing. Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped. Yeah. Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch? I don't know, you tell me. How about then your-your kind of hunch about that? Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so- Mm. -you know, it did, so I'm here- Yeah- -so, I suppose\u2014 -so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here? It's a couple of grand or something. Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah. Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour- Mm. -$25, you do the math. [chuckles] And that's gonna support me? Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles? I don't know. I'm usually an open person. [chuckles] Yeah? Yeah. Just provided it will help me deal with it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about? I don't know. I am just usually pretty open with people. It's a bit different here tonight and- Yeah. -just not knowing what to expect then\u2014 Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far? I don't know. I suppose I'm saying that the money did add up, and that was enough for me to end up here, so- Mm. -I suppose I'm here for a reason. [chuckles] Yeah. You know, like-- I-- And, some people wouldn't even, sort of, get in the door or wouldn't be as open as you've been today, okay, to an extent, so, you know, like I said, good on you, yeah. You know, being able to-- It's hard to come to a place like this and start to really open up, so, you know, you've just shown that you can do that. Yeah. I didn't have a choice. [chuckles]", "response": "Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah.

So? I don't really know what issues I need to sort. Sorry? I don't really know what issues I need to- All right. -sort. It's just a bit of cash. Yeah. So\u2014 So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got? Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age. Yeah. Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries. Yeah, yeah. It's not an issue. Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened? Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night. Yeah, yeah. And some nights you do, so. Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket Well, I don't really keep track. Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub? I don't know. A few times a week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there. That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense? I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink. Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50? Yeah. 'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk] It's the unlucky ones. Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue. Mm. And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014 A bit of a rush, I suppose. A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so. Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling. I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you? Much the same, bunch of party girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies? Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me. Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend? Sarah. Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say? I don't know. What would she say about\u2014 We'd just have a laugh. Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon? Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am. Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah? At times. At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling? I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped. Okay. But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me. Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy. Mm. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does. Mm. So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014 Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause- Yeah. -you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know?

Okay. I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker. Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking? Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking. Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about? Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern. Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you. Oh, yeah. Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects? Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful. Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you. Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked \"No,\" because I never thought of myself as a smoker. Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects. I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all.

Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this. Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five? Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop. Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here? Um, I'd really like some more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new things that can be done to help people make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit.", "response": "Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities. Oh, great. Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and- That sounds bad. Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now. Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco. So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out. But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them. Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day. Oh, no. No. The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth. Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently. Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking. Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis. So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it? Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing. Okay. I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker. Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking? Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking. Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about? Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern. Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you. Oh, yeah. Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects? Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful. Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you. Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked \"No,\" because I never thought of myself as a smoker. Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects. I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So- Mm-hmm. -I'm very concerned. Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking. Really? Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in? Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you. Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall? Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this. Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?

Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay.

That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm.

Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm.

What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.

I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling.

So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?

They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them?

So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea.

That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm.

That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right.

Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS.

So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things.

Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right.

Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.

Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right.

Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.

I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that.

I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right.

A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years.

My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?

I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference.

Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right.

Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer.

Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay.

It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training.

Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes.

Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments.

So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?

They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them?

Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on?

I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?

Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you.

Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm.", "response": "-of disability.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Barbara Roberts? Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that.

Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything.

Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.", "response": "Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind.

Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right.

So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach?", "response": "Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed.

I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right.

Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No.", "response": "- used to get pleasure out of.

I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference.

Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right?

Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know.", "response": "Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up-", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Barbara Roberts?

What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.

So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm.", "response": "- improve your quality of life.

So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?

Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess.

What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.

So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top?

Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right.

So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on?

So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them?

They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm.", "response": "- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly.

My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago.

All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing.

They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then?

My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right.

It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you? I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it- Mm. - and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Mm-hmm.", "response": "And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there.

I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah.

Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you? I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it- Mm. - and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Mm-hmm. And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara? Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week. Yeah. And come and see you again-", "response": "Yes.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Barbara Roberts? Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments.

I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you? I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it- Mm. - and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Mm-hmm. And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara? Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week. Yeah. And come and see you again- Yes. - and talk about it a bit more? Yes. I think so. Okay.", "response": "I think that would be a good- a good start.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Barbara Roberts? Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello.

So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right.

I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you? I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it- Mm. - and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Mm-hmm. And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara? Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week. Yeah. And come and see you again- Yes. - and talk about it a bit more? Yes. I think so. Okay. I think that would be a good- a good start. All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking. Yeah. I won't bring all the bottles down.", "response": "Okay. All right.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Barbara Roberts? Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right.

Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that. Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's- Right. - decided that I've had enough tests. Right. And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet- Mm-hmm. - there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right. Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private. Right. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests? No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years. Mm. You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. Mm. Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies- Mm. - and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough. Yeah. Is that- is that about- I'd say so, yes. - if I got the story right. Yes. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life? Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. Right. Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether. Right. Right. Um, I miss that. Right. I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week. Right. To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing. Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed. Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh. Right. Okay. Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class- Mm-hmm. - that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that. Right. Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. Mm-hmm. That's another thing we don't do anymore now. Right. Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really. Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed- Mm. - quite a lot because of these symptoms. Yes. It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do. Mm. Right. Mm. So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now? Well, I potter around the house- Mm-hmm. - um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say. Mm-hmm. Um, they draw you in, don't they? They certainly do. Um, I read a bit- Mm-hmm. - the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Um, well, last year, um, my son got married- Right. - and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it. Mm-hmm. That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it- Mm-hmm. - and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding. Mm-hmm. But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah. Right. That was a good time. Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Right. Okay. Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up. Right. Right. Which was good. Right. That's interesting. Mm. And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad? Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. Right. It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He- Right. - he travels with his job, and he- Right. - can be away a couple of times a month. Uh-huh. Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say. Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay. Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there. Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. Mm. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you? Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head. Right. You know, he's- he says it's stress. Right. Okay. Mm. And what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain- Right. - for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain. Mm-hmm. Um\u2014 And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it? Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up- Mm-hmm. - in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then- Right. - other times I'll think, \"I wonder if it's an ulcer.\" Right. Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer. Right. Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that- Mm-hmm. - the-the doctor didn't investigate. Right. But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football- Oh, dear. - and it was- it was too late to operate then. Right. Right. So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on. Right. And, uh, yeah, I worry about that. So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night? Oh, yes. To see if you can feel anything? Yes. Right. I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know? Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years. Mm. You've-you've tried a variety of medications- Mm. - some prescribed, some- Mm. - from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations- Mm-hmm. - but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a- Mm. - a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the- Yes. - story right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'd say so. Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here- Mm-hmm. - and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem- Right. - um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments. Right. So perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests? Mm. Okay. Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might- Right. - might reveal. Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this? Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of- Mm. -your life and causing you a lot- Mm. -of disability. Mm. I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Mm. Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy- Mm. - and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less. Mm. And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you- No. - I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What-what sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down. Mm. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you- No. - used to get pleasure out of. Is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah. I can't- I can't do them anymore. Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling- Mm. - unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. And-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you. Oh, I don't know. Mm. I don't know. Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up- Mm. - with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally- Mm. - improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. Mm-hmm. And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess. Hmm. Yeah. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference? Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you? I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it- Mm. - and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Mm-hmm. And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara? Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week. Yeah. And come and see you again- Yes. - and talk about it a bit more? Yes. I think so. Okay. I think that would be a good- a good start. All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking. Yeah. I won't bring all the bottles down. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. I'll do that. So, shall I see you again next week? I'll make an appointment for next week. Yes.", "response": "Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Barbara Roberts? Yes. Morning. Hello, there. Hello. My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you. Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right? Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help. All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind. All right. So, quite a few symptoms there- Mm. - and some of them sound- Yes. - quite troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes. Yes. Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before? Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. Mm-hmm. Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines- Right. - for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium. Right. I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah. Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the- Hmm. - the herbal shop- Hmm. - how are you taking them? Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day- Right. - so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and- Right. - other tablets for other things. So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis- Hmm. - what you're gonna take- Hmm. - depending on what your stomach's doing? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems? Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called? A gastroscopy. That's it. Yes. You got the tube down-down from the top? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema. Right. That was very uncomfortable. Okay. Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything- Right. -and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now- Right. - as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor. Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.

Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work. Mm-hmm.

Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know. Right. They-they left her and- Mm-hmm. - didn't spot it and\u2014 Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this- Mm-hmm. - in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be- Mm. - pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing. Mm. How would that sound? So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you? I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it- Mm. - and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. Mm-hmm. And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara? Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week. Yeah. And come and see you again- Yes. - and talk about it a bit more? Yes. I think so. Okay. I think that would be a good- a good start. All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking. Yeah. I won't bring all the bottles down. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. I'll do that. So, shall I see you again next week?

So, tell me, how are things going? Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back. Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further? No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it. All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds. I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up. But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight. I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do. Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back. Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it. And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have? To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner. John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola? No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving? You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression? Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter. Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in? Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ. Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in. Um, six or seven. All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero? I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight. So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively? Yes. But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?

I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though. Okay. How often? Um, a few times a month. Do you vape anything else besides marijuana? I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me. Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you? Mm-hmm. We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared? Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me. How do you think it affects you? Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend. Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like? Well, I don't want to get in trouble like at school. How could you get in trouble at school? Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team. So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you? Right. So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use? well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start. What would be the benefits of that? Well, I play better when I'm not high. Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you? Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team. Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use? For about a month. Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick? Um, seven. A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five? Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well. So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month? Uh, I don't know. How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape? Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape. What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way? Hmm, I like to play video games. Anything else? I can play basketball with my friend Sarah. Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better. Yeah. Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out. Mm-hmm.", "response": "Well, Good luck with basketball practice.

Would it be okay if I asked you some questions about how marijuana plays a role in your life? Sure. I notice you use marijuana regularly, and I wanted to ask you more about that.
