I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together.

So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.

Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay.

If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.

Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here.

How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay.

If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.

What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.

So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm.

What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah.", "response": "Yeah?

I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here.

Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it?

I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm.

Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah.", "response": "Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them?

And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah.

Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay.

So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens.", "response": "Oh, yeah?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really.

Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm.", "response": "There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage.

That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy.", "response": "No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here.

How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm.", "response": "We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations.

I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know.", "response": "Mm.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm.

I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships?", "response": "Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt.", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy.

Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships? Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. Mm. Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it? Mm-hmm. It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so? Mm-hmm.", "response": "Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch?

So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships? Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. Mm. Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it? Mm-hmm. It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so? Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits. Mm. Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and- Mm-hmm.", "response": "-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay.

Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships? Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. Mm. Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it? Mm-hmm. It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so? Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits. Mm. Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and- Mm-hmm. -what they want to further their dreams, yeah? Mm. Yeah. Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it. Mm-hmm.", "response": "Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that.", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm.

When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships? Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. Mm. Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it? Mm-hmm. It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so? Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits. Mm. Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and- Mm-hmm. -what they want to further their dreams, yeah? Mm. Yeah. Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that. Yeah. Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet? Find the scissors. [laughs] Yeah, find the scissors. Cut out the girls.", "response": "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

[chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships? Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. Mm. Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it? Mm-hmm. It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so? Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits. Mm. Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and- Mm-hmm. -what they want to further their dreams, yeah? Mm. Yeah. Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that. Yeah. Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet? Find the scissors. [laughs] Yeah, find the scissors. Cut out the girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, um, I don't know if the debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find- Yeah. -a way to pay them off and-", "response": "Truly.", "therapist_behavior": "reflection", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm.

So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money. Mm. So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort? [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt. Yeah, okay. Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so- Yeah. -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself. Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with\u2014 Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles] Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford- Mm-hmm. -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that? I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but\u2014 Yeah. Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles] Mm. I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards- Yeah. -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon. Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams? Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles] Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Kids maybe, but- Okay. -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate. Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. \"Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,\" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time- [chuckles] -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, \"Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?\" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point. Mm. And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah? Yeah. When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point? Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles] I don't know. I don't know. It's been fun up to now- What's your hunch? Yeah. -but I really do wanna travel, so. Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what\u2014 Um, Egypt, always been, yeah. Egypt? Yeah. Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh? Oh, I just think it's just fascinating. Yeah? Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and- Oh. -somewhere I've always wanted to go. Yeah. It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles]. No, that's true. Yeah. But for obvious times. Yep. It could be very different. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go? Oh, since I was young, early teens. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream? Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles] Yeah. Well, yeah. Mm. There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow. Mm. Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront? I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle. Yeah. Yeah. It will be a big change. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that? Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy. No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you? Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so. Okay. You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles] Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment. Mm-hmm. We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe- Mm. [chuckles] -it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah? Mm. Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that? Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know. Mm. Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself. Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy. What? Cutting off some of my friendships? Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. Mm. Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it? Mm-hmm. It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so? Mm-hmm. Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits. Mm. Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and- Mm-hmm. -what they want to further their dreams, yeah? Mm. Yeah. Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that. Yeah. Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet? Find the scissors. [laughs] Yeah, find the scissors. Cut out the girls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, um, I don't know if the debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find- Yeah. -a way to pay them off and- Truly. -I don't know how I'm gonna do that. Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a great service here, um, and something that you can get to. Mm.", "response": "So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but- Mm. -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming? I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here. Yeah. I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles] Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, \"Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together- Mm. -and, uh--\" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really. Mm-hmm. So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles? Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, \"Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable.\" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past? Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together? Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget. Yeah? That's why I am still a bit\u2014 Yeah, that's okay. [chuckles] So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if\u2014 When I'm feeling uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, \"Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,\" that would be really helpful. Okay. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.

So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah. About 80. [chuckles] About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life? I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident. Yeah? But, what would- Yes. -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit? What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles] Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out. It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know? Mm. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter- Hmm. -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them? Yeah. Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them?

I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements. Thanks.", "response": "So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going.", "therapist_behavior": "reflection", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking. Okay, like what? Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here. Mm-hmm. Does that sound realistic? Yeah, uh, on the weekends? Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today? No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place- Mm-hmm. -so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety. Mm-hmm. In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep. Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep. Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much. Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two. Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad. That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change? I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five. Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower? Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category. Yes. Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now? Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking. Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you? Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers. Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal? Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week. Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week.

It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. Okay.

I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately. Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom? Yeah. So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today? Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not. Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare? Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out. Okay. Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night. Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be. Yeah. Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy? Yeah. Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability. Yeah. Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son? I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting. Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills? Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts. Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter? Mm-hmm. Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that? Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work. Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you? Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son. Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help? [chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born. Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school? It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out? Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit. Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard? I mean, I think so, yeah. All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom? Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.

Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?

Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites? Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure. Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?

Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites? Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure. Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going? [chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much. Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son? Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke. Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going? Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good. Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan. Okay. All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you. Thanks.

Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there.

Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that.", "response": "Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?", "therapist_behavior": "reflection", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Hi, Laura.

And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon.", "response": "Okay.

Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything.", "response": "Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014", "therapist_behavior": "reflection", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Hi, Laura.

Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?

It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes.", "response": "-and, it's moderately important to you.

So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?

Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah.

I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay.

So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh.

You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?

And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one.", "response": "Okay.

I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay.", "response": "All right, great.

You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you.

How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.

Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay.

And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but- Okay, yeah.", "response": "-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning.

Hi. Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.

Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand- Yeah, that's a good idea.", "response": "-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Hi, Laura. Hi. Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but- Okay, yeah. -of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

Hi. Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but- Okay, yeah. -of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say- Oh okay. -without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand- Yeah, that's a good idea. -and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? Yeah, for sure. Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to- I mean- -to stop drinking. -I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore.

That wasn't me. Uh-huh. So.", "response": "Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Laura. Hi. Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but- Okay, yeah. -of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say- Oh okay. -without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand- Yeah, that's a good idea. -and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? Yeah, for sure. Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to- I mean- -to stop drinking. -I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore.

What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to- I mean- -to stop drinking. -I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me. Uh-huh. So. Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that? Yeah. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure. Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with? No. No, I think I'm okay.", "response": "Okay.

Hi. Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but- Okay, yeah. -of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say- Oh okay. -without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand- Yeah, that's a good idea. -and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? Yeah, for sure. Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to- I mean- -to stop drinking. -I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore.

So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say- Oh okay. -without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand- Yeah, that's a good idea. -and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? Yeah, for sure. Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to- I mean- -to stop drinking. -I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me. Uh-huh. So. Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that? Yeah. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure. Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with? No. No, I think I'm okay. Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going- Okay. -and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together. Okay, great. Thanks.", "response": "That sound okay?", "therapist_behavior": "question", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Laura. Hi. Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown. Yeah. So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school. Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. Hm. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or? Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state. Oh. So, maybe move away for college. Cool. Yeah. So, kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or? Yeah, maybe um, pre-law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting. Yeah. All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun? Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or- Mm-hmm. -something like that, yeah. You like to have a good time? Yeah. And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or? Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends. Mm-hmm. So, I'm like normal. All right. Yeah. That's a good way to be, right? Yeah. [chuckles] All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now? Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay. Okay. Through college. Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging. Okay. Yeah. What's important to you about your family? Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me- Hm. -and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me. Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And, how about friendship? Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So, being a good friend and- Yeah. -having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted- Hm. -in general, yeah. Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group- Yeah. -and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not. Hm. So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something. Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to- Yeah just- -kinda hold a drink. -have one there and pretending to have it. Okay. Yeah. And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How- Um. -often do you think that you are around alcohol. Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most? Okay. Not really much. So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol? Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Uh-huh. Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around- Hm. -or something. So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends. Pretty much, yeah. Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or- Um\u2014 -or mostly just-just with the kids? Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out. Mm-hmm. And, what about driving? Um, like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol? Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you\u2014 Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so. Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous? Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation. So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that- Yeah. -you're not putting yourself- Yeah, definitely. -in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that. Thank you. So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day? Not more than two drinks. Okay. So, the-the absolute most- Yeah. -was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk- Uh-huh. -so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood. Mm-hmm. So. So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or? Yeah, yeah, relaxed. Okay. Uh, anything else? Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much- Mm-hmm. So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you. Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol? Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody. Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who- Yeah. -had some consequences- Yeah. -and decided that's not for you? Yeah. Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of? Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just- Mm-hmm. -very, like, obnoxious things. Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal- Yeah. -and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life. Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles] Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're\u2014 It's just there. It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that? Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone- Okay. -alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved. Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well? Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or? I guess, I mean, since it's just there. Okay. So- Got it. -it ties in with the whole belonging thing. Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any- Mm-hmm. -in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So. Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that. Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals? Yeah, definitely. Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college? Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so- Mm-hmm. -maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon. Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on- Yeah, definitely. -your drinking eventually? For sure. How might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything. Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or\u2014 Definitely, yeah. That's a good word. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing. Maybe a five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something. Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se. Mm-hmm. I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me. So, what number do you think you'd say? Um, on a scale of 1 to 10- Mm-hmm. -if I can quit or not? Yeah. Maybe like an 8 or 9. Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6? Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point- Yes. -and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all. Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring. Uh-huh. It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well. Okay. So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\" What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh-huh. Anything else? Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health. Mm-hmm. So, that would be one. Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you? Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits- Yeah. -having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but- Okay, yeah. -of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much. Wow. And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard.

Yeah, that'd be okay, yeah, you know, I'm not so certain I'm even gonna take the medicine cause, you know, he mentioned muscle weakness, uh, you know, I-I know I got high cholesterol, uh, and that I'm running the risk of stroke and heart attack down line but yeah, he mentioned muscle weakness and I've been thinking about that and, uh, you know I'm a truck driver and I got a haul the heavy boxes out of the truck on a dolly, and I can't afford that right now. Just that-that muscle weakness, uh, that-that bothers me. So-so on the one hand, the doctor talked to you about high cholesterol, down the line possibly causing a stroke or heart attack- Oh, yeah. -and that would be pretty serious. On the other hand, uh, when you found out that this drug might cause muscle weakness, that really alarmed you. Yeah, that's the problem, that's what I face now with my job. Especially with your job and- Yeah. -preventing you from doing your livelihood. Mm-hmm. Okay, um, would you mind if I talk to you, if-if I- if I gave you a little bit of information about the muscle weakness, and you tell me what you think? That'd be fine. Okay. The muscle weakness with this drug is very rare, uh, usually doesn't even happen, okay? Uh, if it happens it usually happens within the first month of taking the medicine, you'll notice it in terms of weakness in the arms, uh, or some muscle pain, it's not usual. If this should happen, uh, if you let the doctor or me know right away, we can get you off the medicine, it's completely reversible. It's, the muscle weakness will go away within a couple of days, right. Oh. Now, you don't wanna let that go on for months at a time, that's when it can become serious. Okay. But otherwise, again it's rare, and it's completely reversible if you let us know. Well, I guess it doesn't worry me quite as much if it's reversible like that. You know, I was thinking this was gonna be a big-time, but, uh, uh, yeah, I guess, it sounds manageable. Okay, and, uh, so talk to me a little bit more about what the doctors told you about-about your risks of stroke or heart attack while you're ta- while you have high cholesterol. Oh, he just said that the risks are-are up, I think he called it elevated but, uh, you know, uh, that I'm at a higher risk of having a stroke or a heart attack down the line, uh, you know, that's down the line. Okay, well how important would it be for you to-to, uh, do whatever you can to reduce your risks of stroke or heart attack down the line? Well, you know, my wife and I wanna retire in about four to five years and we wanna be really active visiting all sorts of places, The Fjords, Norway, things like that so I-I guess having a stroke or a heart attack would really be bad for that so and, you know, we-we-we wanna live our dreams actively. Yeah, and-and one of the- certainly one of the risks of stroke is paralysis, and if you wanna be active that could be- Whoa. -really a problem. Yeah, no-no we-we wanna able to be very active. Okay, well this medicine can really help lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack so that five years so now when you do retire you can enjoy it without any disability, uh, what are your thoughts about that? Well, uh, I guess that's the-the way to go then cause I-I don't wanna be, you know, crippled by a stroke or a heart attack- Sure. -so take- taking the medicine sounds like the-the end of the game right now. Mm-hmm, yeah it would, I-I-I think that would, uh, go a long way toward reducing those risks. Yeah. Okay, um, so if so where we are right now if I understand is you're feeling more comfortable about the concern about muscle weakness? Oh yeah. Uh, you seem fairly committed to taking the medicine to reduce your risk so that you can enjoy your retirement. Yeah. Uh, and so at this point, you're gonna get the medication and- And the medicine can get my cholesterol down? Definitely, can lower your cholesterol to 50%. Wow, okay. So it's pretty effective. Yeah, I'll take the medicine. Okay, um, and at some other point we can talk about some other things that you may be able to do including diet, changes in your eating habits, it can lower your cholesterol even more. Okay. Okay?

Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area. Um, I really like one that's like month to month and doesn't require me to pay out for like a year because, in the summertime, I just don't use that when the weather is nice, I like to be outside. So, um, I do think that that would be an option. Um, I did enjoy doing yoga in the past. I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually. Um, but I really like walking, um, weightlifting, running is okay. Um, that was more at my, like, peak activity level, so I don't think I could start out running now, but I'd like to work up to it. Great. It sounds like there are a lot of activities that you do like- Mm-hmm. -and I'm hearing a theme of climate control, [chuckles] being important to you and you've already been researching gyms. Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that. Yeah. So I just- on my phone, if I'm like in the grocery store, I'm kind of just looking through, and on Google, I'll type in like \"Gyms in the area\" and I'll look and see what's there. And, um, I don't ever want to sign up to learn more 'cause I feel like then they just keep emailing you forever. So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out. Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced- Mm-hmm. -and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website. Yeah. And I completely agree [laughs]about wanting to avoid the sales pitch- Mm-hmm. -um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step? Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me. Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me. Okay.

So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather- Mm-hmm. -or the perfect gym? Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere.

Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area.

So it might be a safe place to explore first- Mm-hmm. -and to build some confidence in that conversation. Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out. Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather- Mm-hmm. -or the perfect gym? Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all. Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all? Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it. That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs- Mm-hmm. -and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound? No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting. Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started. Yeah, I think so. Okay, fantastic.

Well, I think, um, like when I was really active in the past, I enjoy going to the gym and I like that regardless of what's happening with the weather outside, that-that's always an option. Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area. Um, I really like one that's like month to month and doesn't require me to pay out for like a year because, in the summertime, I just don't use that when the weather is nice, I like to be outside.

I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually.

So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me.

So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced- Mm-hmm. -and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right.

Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me.

I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable.

So it might be a safe place to explore first- Mm-hmm. -and to build some confidence in that conversation. Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out. Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather- Mm-hmm. -or the perfect gym? Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all. Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all? Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it. That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs- Mm-hmm. -and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound? No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting. Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started. Yeah, I think so. Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals? I think I'm at a 10. Okay. Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah. Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through? Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like- Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside. Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah. Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session? No, I feel really good. I think even coming in, I didn't have a like step-by-step idea of what I wanted to do next, but no, this has been helpful to know what those small steps are, and like you said, hopefully, I do start feeling better.

But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it? Right- right. Okay. Yeah. So, I don't even know where you can get those. I think\u2014 Oh, I already have one. Oh, you have one? Yeah, [laughs]. Oh, okay- okay. It came home with me. Oh, did you? Yeah. Okay. All right. It's stuff that I learnt in class. It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]- That'd be great, yeah, please. So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy. That's- that's something I'd be really interested in. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I mean, I- I, um, I've always liked therapy itself, and I- I've heard, I don't know if it's accurate, but if you have the willingness that is you're ease- more easily hypnotized, I don't know is it true? Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you? Well, I mean exercise, but really, you know, I have the mindset, you know, like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to get up and I'm going to do this, but I really am not a follow-through type of person with this. Okay. Okay. Because you know I've never been really athletic. I mean, so it's kind of like, I know that when you substitute something for something else, other than chocolate, which is my best friend too, [laughs]. Might become a better friend when you quit. Yeah. Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin? You know, I've heard of Welbutrin. Okay. My girlfriend quit smoking. She quit drinking. She quit doing everything with this Wellbutrin. Now I- I- I am on some medications, like some, like I think that's an antidepressant. Yes, it is. Okay. Um, I'd be open to that and then I'm not sure-- I'm not familiar with the other thing that you had suggested. Um, I don't know what that is. It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them. The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler. Um, you know I'd be-- I've heard a little bit about them, but I mean I do know some people, but they're not exactly reliable, um, as far as you know really having a desire and sticking to it that they smoke on the patch and-and then it causes this you know extreme, you know? Like you're getting double the nicotine or whatever so it's almost like they're getting a buzz from it you know so that's my fear and the cost of the patch because it's not covered you know through your, um, your- your insurance and the Nicorette same thing it's very expensive you know. And I'm not really a gum sure but here I am because\u2014 Chewing gum. [laughs] but I mean I'd be interested I wish they'd make it more affordable for people or you know they haven't covered by insurance because you know the risk of it you know that the premiums for insurance- insurance for people who smoke are so high you would think that they would have like, um, what do they call that? Preventive. Um, I wish I never would have started and I'm proud of my daughter you know because I started smoking a little bit earlier than her age, and I'm proud that she is at this point not smoking this manifestation she might pick it up but it's- it's like- That strong spirit of you got instilled with her.

Um, what did the doctors say to you when you were diagnosed? I mean the obvious, right? Every time I go-- Excuse me. -to any doctor, you know, you need to quit smoking and\u2014 Mm-hmm. Finger comes out. Uh-huh and I kind of go, let's move on, you know because I've heard the lecture. Um, and I really don't put much credence into what they say. I did have- I did have a neighbor who was smoked for many, many years and, um, she had the Oxygen-- Oxygen tank that she would have to sleep at night with the oxygen on and even that didn't deter me from that smoking. I don't really know. It's like, um, a power greater than myself. This is controlling me like this, you know, the angels on this side, the devil's on the other. Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on? Mm-hmm, yeah. And common sense somewhere in the middle. Yeah. Well, and your daughter. Right. And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know.

So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball. Mm-hmm. It shows you your lung capacity. Right. Which I barely have any. But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it? Right- right. Okay. Yeah. So, I don't even know where you can get those. I think\u2014 Oh, I already have one. Oh, you have one? Yeah, [laughs]. Oh, okay- okay. It came home with me. Oh, did you? Yeah. Okay. All right. It's stuff that I learnt in class. It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]- That'd be great, yeah, please. So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy. That's- that's something I'd be really interested in. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I mean, I- I, um, I've always liked therapy itself, and I- I've heard, I don't know if it's accurate, but if you have the willingness that is you're ease- more easily hypnotized, I don't know is it true? Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you? Well, I mean exercise, but really, you know, I have the mindset, you know, like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to get up and I'm going to do this, but I really am not a follow-through type of person with this. Okay. Okay. Because you know I've never been really athletic. I mean, so it's kind of like, I know that when you substitute something for something else, other than chocolate, which is my best friend too, [laughs]. Might become a better friend when you quit. Yeah. Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin? You know, I've heard of Welbutrin. Okay. My girlfriend quit smoking. She quit drinking. She quit doing everything with this Wellbutrin. Now I- I- I am on some medications, like some, like I think that's an antidepressant. Yes, it is. Okay. Um, I'd be open to that and then I'm not sure-- I'm not familiar with the other thing that you had suggested. Um, I don't know what that is. It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them. The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler. Um, you know I'd be-- I've heard a little bit about them, but I mean I do know some people, but they're not exactly reliable, um, as far as you know really having a desire and sticking to it that they smoke on the patch and-and then it causes this you know extreme, you know? Like you're getting double the nicotine or whatever so it's almost like they're getting a buzz from it you know so that's my fear and the cost of the patch because it's not covered you know through your, um, your- your insurance and the Nicorette same thing it's very expensive you know. And I'm not really a gum sure but here I am because\u2014 Chewing gum. [laughs] but I mean I'd be interested I wish they'd make it more affordable for people or you know they haven't covered by insurance because you know the risk of it you know that the premiums for insurance- insurance for people who smoke are so high you would think that they would have like, um, what do they call that? Preventive. Um, I wish I never would have started and I'm proud of my daughter you know because I started smoking a little bit earlier than her age, and I'm proud that she is at this point not smoking this manifestation she might pick it up but it's- it's like- That strong spirit of you got instilled with her. Yeah-yeah, maybe I'm the best example of why she doesn't want to [laughs] you know Could be? Whatever you know and her friends. I think a lot of her friend's parents don't smoke and I'm constantly running like outside to smoke and-and- It is becoming a pain in the butt It is. It really is. It's a monkey on my back Mm-hmm And um for me smoking is like a calming effect, you know. And some people it's a stimulant you know and then for me, it's like, I look forward to relaxing on my couch after a long day and then watching my you know news or whatever the heck I'm watching or reading and having my cigarette, um, I'll tell you- Like it's a little treat. Right. Exactly or you know like I'll do some work, and then I'm like okay you know as my ex-husband says Union break and it's a cigarette break. [laughs] I've never heard of Union break. I love it how you said. I love it. Yeah. Absolutely it's not my quote but he actually he would mind. I love it. Union break. Yeah It's great Yeah, you know how those union workers have to have you know, Union break. Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay Yeah, financially too, which is [inaudible 00:09:27]", "response": "Financially.

So, um, everyone that comes on the South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]? Um, I have to start getting the school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class. Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days? Yes. Okay. What a great goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself? Uh, so people will get off my back. And who are these people? My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and I don't want to go back in. So that's something you definitely wanna avoid? Yes. Okay. So getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal. I will try. So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour? I can't ever get up in the morning. So that's hard and then by the time I do get up, and then I get ready and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find a ride. So it could be a bunch of different reasons why I'm late. Okay, so it's not just one major thing? No. So knowing that a couple of things can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do? Get up on time would probably be a good start of making me get there on time. What time would you need to get up then? [sighs] If I'm gonna catch the bus I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause I go to bed so late and I don't know if I can do it.

I could try- Okay. - and see how it goes. Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it? Yes. So what time would you have to go to bed at night to make sure you're up by 6:15? I go about midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00. Okay. Okay, so you're willing to go to bed at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning? Yes. When would be a great day for you to start this? Uh, either tomorrow or the next day. Okay, so if I would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? Tomorrow or the next day? Let's start tomorrow. Tomorrow. Okay, great. So who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15? My mom. Your mom. Mm-hmm. Okay. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that? [sighs] She can after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I have to do it. So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, \"Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class\". Exactly.

Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves. Right. I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\" Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right? That's right. Okay. Is there anything I missed? Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me- Mm-hmm. -we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family. Right. The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard- Sure. -have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us. So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette. I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right. You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you? Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt well for a while.

I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you. Good morning, doctor. How can I help you today? Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD. Yes. And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking. Right. So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something. It's time to do something, okay.

I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit. Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.

So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened. Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it. Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by? I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself. Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing. I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch. Mm-hmm. I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit. Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital. I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked. Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you? Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand. Mm-hmm. Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves. Right. I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\" Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right? That's right. Okay. Is there anything I missed? Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me- Mm-hmm. -we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family. Right. The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard- Sure. -have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us. So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette. I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right. You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you? Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers. Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you? Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics. Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking. Yes. So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking? It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking. Definitely most important. Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things. Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit? Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent. 35-40%. Okay. Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-", "response": "Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.", "therapist_behavior": "reflection", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Hi, Jean.

So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking? It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking. Definitely most important. Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things. Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit? Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent. 35-40%. Okay. Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um- Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit. Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So- Mm-hmm. -this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week. Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%? Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help. So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%. I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.", "response": "Okay.", "therapist_behavior": "other", "client_talk_type": "neutral"}, {"context": "Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you. Good morning, doctor. How can I help you today? Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD. Yes. And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking. Right. So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something. It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by- A respirologist. A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now? I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers. All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened. Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it. Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by? I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself. Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing. I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch. Mm-hmm. I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit. Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital. I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked. Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you? Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand. Mm-hmm. Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves. Right. I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\" Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right? That's right. Okay. Is there anything I missed? Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me- Mm-hmm. -we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family. Right. The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard- Sure. -have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us. So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette. I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right. You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you? Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers. Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you? Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics.

So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking? It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking. Definitely most important. Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things. Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit? Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent. 35-40%. Okay. Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um- Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit. Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So- Mm-hmm. -this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week. Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%? Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help. So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%. I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today. Okay. Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out. Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that? In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically. That's correct. And writing it down helps that process. Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge- Mm-hmm. -and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.", "response": "Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?", "therapist_behavior": "therapist_input", "client_talk_type": "change"}, {"context": "Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you. Good morning, doctor. How can I help you today? Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD. Yes. And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking. Right. So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something. It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by- A respirologist. A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now? I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers. All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened. Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it. Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by? I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself. Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing. I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch. Mm-hmm. I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit. Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital. I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked. Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you? Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand. Mm-hmm. Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves. Right. I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\" Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right? That's right. Okay. Is there anything I missed? Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me- Mm-hmm. -we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family. Right. The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard- Sure. -have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us. So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette. I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right. You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you? Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well. Mm-hmm. I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers. Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you? Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics. Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera.

You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away. So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using? Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try. Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely- Mm-hmm. -with zero being not ready at all- Mm. -and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself? Uh, three. Why not a one or a two? I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two. Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine? Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes. Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV. Yeah. Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine? Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life. How could you get a different social life? It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it. Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?

Which drugs do you use? I do some meth. Snort it, smoke it? Snort it, always snort it. Don't inject it? Mm-mm. Use any other drugs? Just, you know, some alcohol. And, uh, um, you do this how often? Meth? Mm-hmm. Um, two, three times a month. So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often? Right. Only snort it? Right. Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user.

And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use? Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high. So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?
