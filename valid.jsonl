Cutting off some of my friendships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, it's a couple of ideas.

Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep?

We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm. [chuckles]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do.

Cutting off some of my friendships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep?

Cutting off some of my friendships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, it's a couple of ideas.

So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah.

Yeah?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, yep.

Cutting off some of my friendships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Find the scissors.

Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a great service here, um, and something that you can get to."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm, that will be good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}]

Your job is to provide counseling for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, like what?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does that sound realistic?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, uh, on the weekends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

Are you familiar with that program?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've heard of it, but I don't know that much."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program.

So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended.

He's almost three."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you.

Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah.

Your job is to provide counseling for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, exactly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, I think so, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

That's a good word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe a five or six."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

That's a good word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe a five or six."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah. Definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, what number do you think you'd say?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, on a scale of 1 to 10-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-if I can quit or not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe like an 8 or 9."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh-huh."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?"}]

That's a good word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe a five or six."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

So, it's not really that difficult"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it.

Anything else?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, that would be one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes."}]

That's a good word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10?

Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that would be okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, great.

That's a good word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10?

Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that would be okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that's a good idea."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, for sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-to stop drinking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore.

So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that's a good idea."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there.

Uh, anything else?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-had some consequences-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and decided that's not for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-very, like, obnoxious things."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're—"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's just there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess, I mean, since it's just there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-it ties in with the whole belonging thing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-your drinking eventually?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "For sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How might that go?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or—"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Definitely, yeah. That's a good word."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe a five or six."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah. Definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, what number do you think you'd say?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, on a scale of 1 to 10-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-if I can quit or not?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe like an 8 or 9."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh-huh."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, I could just tell them, \"Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh-huh. Anything else?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, that would be one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that would be okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, that's a good idea."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, for sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-to stop drinking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Uh-huh."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No. No, I think I'm okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, great. Thanks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sound okay?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right. Thanks so much."}]

So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right. Okay.

Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms.

I don't know much about their pricing or anything like that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I agree."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So something to look into if you're interested."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym.

That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Great.

I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I think so."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I think I'm at a 10."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general.

And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?"}]

I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Is there anything I missed?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Definitely most important."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "35-40%. Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's correct. And writing it down helps that process."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mm-hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent.
